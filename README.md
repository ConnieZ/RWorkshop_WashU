# Crashcourse R at Washington University in St. Louis

This repository contains files for the Crashcourse in R (Beginner) at Washington University in St. Louis on May 5, 2015.

The sample data of NYC flights for 2013 was created based on the datasets in package "nycflights13". Feel free to install it using
